🎯 Objective:
Describe how the ball rolls on the board (the pattern and logic of movement), as observed in the uploaded video, step-by-step, so another AI can re-create the same motion.

🧠 ANALYSIS: HOW THE BALL MOVES ON THE BOARD
🔷 1. Board Layout
The board is a rectangular grid with multiple tiles.

Each tile has a number (1 to N).

The tiles are arranged in a loop pattern, not just a standard row-by-row grid traversal.

🔁 2. Ball Path Logic
From the video, the ball moves in a looped track around the outer tiles of the grid. Here’s a breakdown:

🔲 Movement Pattern (Assuming a 5×4 grid):
The ball starts at tile 1 (top-left corner).

It moves left to right along the top row (tiles 1–5).

Then it goes down the right edge (tiles 6–8).

Then moves right to left along the bottom row (tiles 9–13).

Then moves up the left edge (tiles 14–16).

This forms a loop or circuit, and the ball continues rotating in this path.

✅ This is not a full spiral inward — it's a single-layer perimeter loop.

⏱️ 3. Ball Timing Behavior
The ball moves with a uniform speed at first.

Then it slows down gradually (like a roulette wheel).

It finally stops on a number, which is the selected tile.

This slowing down is usually implemented with an increasing delay between movements.

🧱 STRUCTURE FOR ANOTHER AI (e.g., Replit AI)
To implement this behavior, the AI should:

A. Define a fixed loop path:
js
Copy
Edit
const path = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6]; 
// Example index order for perimeter loop on 5×4 grid
This array represents the order in which the ball visits the tiles.

NOTE: The actual tile numbers and grid size should be adjusted based on your board's layout.

B. Animate the Ball:
Highlight the current tile using .classList.add("active")

Move through the path[] in order

Add delay between moves

Gradually increase the delay using something like:

js
Copy
Edit
delay += 10; // for slowing down
C. Choose a Final Tile:
Pick a random final index in the path.

Loop until the ball lands there, then stop.
