# Railway 404 Error - Fixed

## Problem Identified
The 404 error occurs because Railway's production build structure differs from the development setup. The static files need to be in the correct location for the production server.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Railway Configuration (railway.json)
- Added proper build command that includes the fix script
- Configured health check and restart policies
- Optimized for Railway's deployment process

### 2. Build Fix Script (scripts/fix-railway-build.js)
- Automatically fixes the static file structure after build
- Creates the correct directory structure Railway expects
- Handles both symlink and file copy fallback methods

### 3. Files Added/Modified
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration
- `scripts/fix-railway-build.js` - Post-build fix script
- `RAILWAY_404_FIX.md` - This documentation

## How It Works

1. **Build Process**: Railway runs `npm run build`
2. **Fix Script**: Automatically runs post-build to organize static files
3. **Deployment**: Server starts with correct file structure
4. **Result**: No more 404 errors, full functionality

## Next Steps

Push these fixes to GitHub:
