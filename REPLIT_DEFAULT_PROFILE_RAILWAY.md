# Using Default Replit Profile "nwachukwuprecio" with Railway

## Your Current Setup
- **Replit Username**: nwachukwuprecio
- **Git Name**: Nwachukwu precious
- **Git Email**: 140493129+Preshy62@users.noreply.github.com
- **GitHub Account**: @Preshy62 (linked through email)

## Profile Mismatch Implications

### What This Means:
- **Local Replit Identity**: nwachukwuprecio
- **Git Commits**: Show as "Nwachukwu precious"
- **GitHub Repository Owner**: @Preshy62
- **Railway Deployment**: Will use @Preshy62 GitHub account

### For Railway Hosting:

**Repository Creation:**
- Repository will be created under GitHub account @Preshy62
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/Preshy62/big-boys-game`
- Commits will show: "Nwachukwu precious"

**Railway Connection:**
- Railway connects to GitHub account @Preshy62
- Uses OAuth with your GitHub account
- Ignores local Replit username
- Project owner: @Preshy62

## Practical Implications

### Positive:
- **No conflicts** - Railway only cares about GitHub account
- **Seamless deployment** - Direct GitHub integration
- **Cost savings** - $2-4/month vs $15-20 on Replit
- **Professional setup** - Real GitHub repository ownership

### Considerations:
- **Different usernames** across platforms (normal and acceptable)
- **Commit attribution** - Shows real name, not username
- **Repository ownership** - Under @Preshy62, not nwachukwuprecio

## Railway Deployment Process

1. **Push from Replit** → GitHub (@Preshy62)
2. **Railway connects** → GitHub (@Preshy62)
3. **Deploy from repository** → Production hosting
4. **Result**: Professional hosting under your GitHub account

## No Changes Needed

Your current setup works perfectly:
- Keep using nwachukwuprecio in Replit for development
- Repository automatically goes to @Preshy62 on GitHub
- Railway deploys from @Preshy62 GitHub account
- Everything works seamlessly together

The username difference is normal and doesn't affect functionality. Railway will host your Big Boys Game professionally regardless of local Replit username.
