# How Railway Connects to Your Code

## Railway CANNOT See Replit Directly

Railway has no access to:
- Your Replit workspace
- Replit username "nwachukwuprecio" 
- Local Replit git configuration
- Files stored only in Replit

## The Connection Path

```
Replit (nwachukwuprecio) → GitHub (@Preshy62) → Railway
```

### Step 1: Replit to GitHub
- You push code from Replit to GitHub
- Uses your git email: 140493129+Preshy62@users.noreply.github.com
- Creates repository at: github.com/Preshy62/big-boys-game
- Repository owner: @Preshy62 (your GitHub account)

### Step 2: Railway to GitHub
- Railway connects to GitHub using OAuth
- You sign into Railway with your GitHub account (@Preshy62)
- Railway reads repositories from @Preshy62
- Railway deploys from github.com/Preshy62/big-boys-game

## What Railway Sees

Railway only sees:
- Your GitHub repositories
- Repository content (code files)
- GitHub account info (@Preshy62)
- Commit history (shows "Nwachukwu precious")

Railway never sees:
- Replit username "nwachukwuprecio"
- Replit workspace
- Local development environment

## The Process

1. **Upload to GitHub**: Use Replit's Version Control panel or git commands
2. **Connect Railway**: Sign in with GitHub account @Preshy62  
3. **Select Repository**: big-boys-game from your GitHub repositories
4. **Deploy**: Railway builds and hosts from GitHub code

## Why This Works

Your git configuration links Replit to GitHub:
- Git email: 140493129+Preshy62@users.noreply.github.com
- This connects to GitHub account @Preshy62
- Railway connects to the same GitHub account
- Complete chain of connection established

Railway is essentially GitHub → Production hosting. Your Replit profile doesn't matter to Railway.
