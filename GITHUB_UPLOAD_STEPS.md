# GitHub Upload Steps - Use Replit's Version Control Panel

## Current Status
- Git repository exists but has lock files
- Need to use Replit's UI instead of command line

## Steps to Upload:

### Method 1: Version Control Panel (Recommended)
1. **Look for the git/source control icon** in your left sidebar (usually looks like a branch symbol)
2. **Click "Version Control"** or the git icon
3. **Review changes** - you should see all your project files
4. **Add commit message**: `Big Boys Game - Production ready with auto cleanup and 45% bot win rate`
5. **Click "Commit and Push"**
6. **Repository settings**:
   - Name: `big-boys-game`
   - Visibility: **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
   - Click "Create Repository"

### Method 2: Replit's Publish Feature
1. **Go to Replit dashboard** (click Replit logo)
2. **Find this project** in your project list
3. **Click three dots (...)** next to project name
4. **Select "Publish to GitHub"**
5. **Repository name**: `big-boys-game`
6. **Set to Public**
7. **Click "Publish"**

## What Gets Uploaded
Your complete Big Boys Game including:
- Automatic game cleanup system (removes waiting games after 1 hour)
- Bot win rate set to 45% for single player games
- Production environment configuration
- Secure session management
- Payment integration setup
- Admin dashboard
- Railway deployment guides

## After Upload
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/Preshy62/big-boys-game`
- Ready for Railway deployment
- Cost: $2-4/month vs $15-20 on Replit

Try the Version Control panel first - it bypasses the git lock file issues completely.
